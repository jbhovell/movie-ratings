## Movie Ratings
I love watching movies, but only if they are recommended by other audiences so I don't waste too much of my time.

So, I wrote this little app to help me search movies I am interested in, calculate average ratings from multiple trusted sources for each of them, and list them from high to low ratings.

#### Run
```
npm i
npm start
http://localhost:3000
```

On the home page, fill in the form with the keyword in the movie title, submit, and it will pull out the results for you.


#### Todo

limit the words/chars in comments

subscriber don't see adverts, and more features

free users see adverts to films, netflix, amazon prime video etc

SEO, register it on movie related websites.

deploy to heroku and aws

shall I use better api than https://www.omdbapi.com?
