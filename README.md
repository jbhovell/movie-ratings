## Movie Ratings
I love watching movies, but only if they are recommended by other audiences so I don't waste too much of my time.

So, I wrote this little app to help me search movies, calculate average ratings from multiple sources for each of them, and list them from high to low ratings.

### Run
npm i
npm start
http://localhost:3000

Fill in the form with the keyword in the movie title, submit, it will pull out the results for you.
